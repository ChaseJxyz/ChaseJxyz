### Info

Since I sure as heck can't afford to go back to college (and I don't have any sort of tuition/training benefits from work), I have to pick up all sorts of courses from all over the place!

If I gave you a link to my portfolio, there's a folder that has PDFs of all the relevent ones. This is a "master" list of all of them, grouped by "type"/impressiveness (i.e. was there a proctored exam attached, do they confer CPEs, etc.). I'll also list a couple skills that are attached to each, to give some context.
