### Hello!

I'm Chase! J dot xyz. I consider myself a "digital storyteller" since I love creating stories in digital formats. A lot of the time that's just writing words to be read on the web, but sometimes that also means interactive stuff, too. Those things will go here.

Bachelor's of Science degree in Journalism with Creative Writing minor (and some web makin' classes) \- Rochester Institute of Technology 2013.

Digital marketing analyst day job at eCommerce B2B \+ B2C book retailer. San Francisco Bay Area, California.

He/him or they/them.

I'm most familiar/comfortable with HTML \+ CSS and can do SOME JavaScript, though anything more than basic 90's websites is out of my skill level at this point. I know some Python, too, and want to learn more. I can do Markdown but I don't like it, I'd much rather use a program where I can SEE the formatting as it happens. I write normal words in Word or Scrivener and then turn them into interactive things in VSCode. I use Excel in ways it shouldn't, and I'll definitely learn Python once they put it in Excel.

Contact info can be found on my profile's sidebar or on my website \(which is also in the sidebar\).
